## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to analyse the Income statements of S&P 500 companies to understand their financial status.

This project was divided into three parts:

1.	Exploratory Analysis of the Data using Visuals
2.	Profit and Loss Statement Dashboard
3.	Forecast Modelling

## Data Source 
The dataset was provided by Udacity and a copy of it can be found  [here](Dataset)

## Skills and Concepts demonstrated
- Use of Excel functions such as Xlookup, Index and Match, Unique, Offset
- Excel Name Range
- Data validation 
- Financial reporting
- Forecasting Modelling and 
- Sensitivity Analysis

## Data Cleaning

Before delving into the full analysis, i performed some basic cleaning on the dataset to be able to work with the data.

Based on the above picture that shows the uncleaned data, below are the steps taken to clean and prepare the data for use:

- I removed all the $ signs using the Find and Replace option because the sign didn’t allow for mathematical operations to be performed on the data. I also removed all the hyphen (-) from the data.

- Then I changed the numerical columns to accounting (dollars) since the dataset comes from the United States.

- The period Ending column was not properly aligned so I made the necessary changes to the column.

_Now the data is ready to be worked on, remember we have three tasks to complete in this project. So we will be starting with the first part_

## Analysis

### Exploratory Analysis of the Data using Visuals
![](https://github.com/zizou-io/Financial-Analysis-of-the-NYSE/blob/main/reports/Dashboard.png)

This part required that I dug into the data and generated some insights. To achieve this, I answered three questions.

**1. What is the Distribution of Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold?**
I used a histogram to show the revenue distribution and then used a scatter plot to find the type of relationship that exists between Revenue and the cost of goods sold.
As we can see in the chart below, most of the companies generated revenue higher than $ 17 billion. There is also a positive linear relationship between Revenue and Cost of goods sold.

**2. Does Higher revenue translate to a High Operating Income?**
Operating Income also known as EBIT is the amount of money left after removing Total Operating Expenses (such as Research and Design Costs, Operating Item Costs, Sales, General and, Admin costs) from the Gross Profit. I wanted to find out if having a higher revenue also meant the operating income would be high.

![](https://github.com/zizou-io/Financial-Analysis-of-the-NYSE/blob/main/reports/RevenueVsOperatingIncom.PNG)

The first chart displayed the total revenue generated by each industry. The Consumer Staples sector had the highest revenue. The second chart showed the Total Operating Income of each sector, noticing that Information Technology generated the highest operating income which was over $300B more than the Consumer staple. This showed that a high revenue does not translate to a high operating income.

**3. Comparing Total Operating Expenses Between Information Technology and Industrial Sectors**
Remember the last question we answered revealed that the IT sector generated the highest operating income, but I discovered that the Industrial and the IT sectors have almost the same number of companies, 248 and 230 companies respectively. However, the operating Income generated by the Industrial sector is about $ 300 billion less than the IT’s.

To see what could be the cause of such discrepancy, I compared their total operating expenses to see how much expenses each company incurred.

The column above chart shows that the Industrial sector incurred higher total operating expenses compared to the IT sector hence the reason for the IT sector having high Operating Income.




### Profit and Loss Statement Dashboard
This is the second part of the project. The required task is given below:

Created a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. Include all companies from the raw data. The P&L statement included the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
![](https://github.com/zizou-io/Financial-Analysis-of-the-NYSE/blob/main/reports/PL.JPG)
The approaches I took to answer this part are as follows:

Opened a new worksheet
I used data validation to create a drop-down list where I selected all the Unique companies from the raw data. This validation allows one to choose any Ticker Symbol of choice to see its P&L statement.
For the Sub-Industry, I used the Xlookup function to match the ticker symbol to the Sub-Industry from the raw data. What this does is that whenever any ticker is selected, its corresponding Sub-Industry would be shown beneath it.
The raw data contains four years of financial data reported by each company, so I created the four years of historical data(year 1, year 2, year 3, and year 4).
Index and Match functions were used to get the Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, Sales, General and Admin., Research and Development, and Other Operating Items for each year of the selected Ticker Symbol. For example, to get the revenue for the year, we use the formula =**INDEX(Revenue, MATCH(1,($B$2=Ticker)*(C$7=Year),0))**.
Gross Profit was calculated using the Formula **(Revenue- Cost of Goods Sold)** for each year.
Operating Income/EBIT was calculated using the formula **(Gross Profit — Total Operating Expenses)** for each year.







### Forecast Modelling
![](https://github.com/zizou-io/Financial-Analysis-of-the-NYSE/blob/main/reports/BaseCase.JPG)

This part is a bit tricky but I will do my best to break it down for easy understanding.

Requirement

Create a financial model for a company of your choice that forecasts the **Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT** for two more years using three scenarios **(Best case, Weak case, and Base case)**. Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario.

- Merck & Co. is an American Pharmaceutical company that deals with delivering innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, and animal health products. I selected this company because I noticed it spent a lot on its Cost of goods sold compared to other companies in the same sub-industry, so I wanted to see if this would affect its subsequent Revenue, Gross profit, and Operating Income.

To forecast the Revenue, Gross profit, and Operating Income for the years 5 and 6, I need the operating statistics which are:

- Revenue Growth (%): (Current year Revenue / Previous Year Revenue) - 1
- Gross Margin: 1 - (Cost of Revenue/Total Revenue)
- Operating Margin: Operating Income/Total Revenue**
![](https://github.com/zizou-io/Financial-Analysis-of-the-NYSE/blob/main/reports/OperatingStat.JPG)

The image showed the calculated operating statistics based on the above formulas.

The Assumptions part shows the calculations for Years 5 and 6 respectively and these are what would be used to forecast the Income statement for Years 5 and 6.

To do this, I useD the following formulas.

**Revenue:** Previous Year Revenue * (1+assumed Revenue growth)
e.g., Let’s forecast the revenue for year 5 using the formula.
**$39,498,000,000 * (1+(-6.5%) = $36,930,630,000**

**Gross Profit:** Previous year revenue * Assumed Gross margin.
Calculating the gross profit for year 5, we will multiply year 4 revenue by the year 5 assumed gross margin.
**e. g $39,498,000,000 * 0.62 = $24,488,760,000**

**Operating Income/EBIT:** Previous year Revenue * Assumed Operating Income
Using the above formula, we can forecast the year 5 operating income as follows.
**e. g $39,498,000,000 * 0.17 = $6,714,660,000**

Those are processes followed to forecast the years 5 and 6 Profit and Loss statement but there are more step based on the project’s requirements that said we should create a sensitivity scenario for the Forecast Revenue, Gross Profit, and Operating Income to change based on the Weak, Base and Best scenarios. The example I gave above was based on the scenario that our operating statistics for years 5 and 6 would remain the same (base case). But we can also look at the situation whereby we might have lesser (weak) or more (strong) than that.

This is where the sensitivity Analysis comes in.
![](https://github.com/zizou-io/Financial-Analysis-of-the-NYSE/blob/main/reports/Scenario.JPG)

The table above calculated the Revenue growth, Gross margin, and Operating Margin using the Best case, Base case, and Weak case scenarios. This enables us to view our forecast model by changing the scenarios to any of the three cases.
Insights derived from the Forecast Model

As can be seen from the historical years, the Revenue, gross profit, and operating income generated by the company reduced every year and this was also reflected in the 5th and 6th year based on the forecasting carried out.
Using the base case, weak case, and best case scenarios to forecast the company’s income statement still shows that the company will lose money in all cases.
Recommendation

The company should look into its total operating expenses and see how it can cut down on it.
